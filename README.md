## Math 128A: Numerical Analysis (Prof. John Strain)

Summer 2019. Discussion on the course is available at https://dsury.com/numerical-analysis/ . 

Problem sets here are lengthy but provide invaluable insight on the subject matter. I highly recommend taking this course with Strain, as you will come out of it having gained a lot.
